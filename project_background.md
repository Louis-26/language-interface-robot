# Task
construct a natural language interface (NLI) for surgical robotic system, so that the surgeon can control
ENT(ear, nose, throat) surgical robots using voice commands, freeing their hands for more precise operations 
and improving overall efficiency in the operating room.

Additionally, apply **open source model** GPT-OSS instead of **cloud based model** GPT-4o to avoid uploading
patient data to the cloud, ensuring data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations.
